Selection of variables and Features:

For the current project only the measurements on mean and standard deviation for each measurement have been extracted.
The values for variables:
Activity are in "Y_train.txt" and "Y_test.txt"
Subject are in "subject_train.txt" and "subject_test.txt"
Features are in "X_train.txt" and X_test.txt"
Similarly names of variables in features and labels of variable in activity come from "features.txt" and "activity_labels.txt" respectively.

These three will be used for descriptive variables to name the activities in the dataset.

The data was sebset to include the required variables mean and standard deviation measurements only to generate a tidy dataset.
